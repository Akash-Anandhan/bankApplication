# Task 5: Bank Account Simulation (Java OOP)

## Project Title
Java Developer Internship - Task 5: Bank Account Simulation

## Description
This project simulates basic bank operations using **Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The code demonstrates core concepts like **Classes**, **Inheritance**, **Encapsulation**, and **Method Overriding** to model a realistic bank account system, including a transaction log.

## Features Implemented
* **Account Management:** Uses an abstract `Account` class for base functionality.
* **Transactions:** Implements `deposit()` and `withdraw()` methods.
* **Balance Tracking:** Securely maintains the account balance.
* **Transaction History:** Logs all transactions in an `ArrayList`.
* **Inheritance:** Includes a `SavingsAccount` subclass to showcase **Method Overriding** (e.g., imposing a withdrawal limit) and specific features (e.g., applying interest).

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
* Classes and Objects
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Method Overriding
* Polymorphism

## How to Run
1.  Compile the single Java file (`BankAccountSimulation.java`).
2.  Run the compiled class from the terminal: `java BankAccountSimulation`
